# IGame2
Manual Game Collection Management Tool - A place for your collected games of all sorts!

Simple Beta Trial - I am not the best with getting things out and about to showcase. There is no site or discord yet.
Time taken to build beta - 3 hours in total including concept time... I would guess, it's rather simple.

How to use IGame2 and its purpose? (Trial Beta, all is set to change/update but may not if it does not gain traction)

It's quite simple gather up image posters and titles for your games (Not Provided via API sorry for broad support of titles vs API only)
Select to add a new game, it will prompt you via an OpenFileDialog to select the Poster Image first. 
Go ahead and select one for example I chose "Assassin's Creed" but PS3 cover.
It will Prompt you after for a name, (This will save a txt file in IGame2's current directory under Games as the name you choose and effect the sorting of the game)
Then it will show the game image in your Library, when you first press the game image it will have you select the game file. 
This is where you can select a game of any file type for example (.gba,.n64,.3ds,.exe,.etc) and so on.
(if you make a mistake you can open the .txt file in the Games Directory and edit it)
Good to go! Now it will appear in your list until deleted from the Games folder. Simply pressing it will attempt to start the selected file.
I recommend finding programs you can associate with the filetype extensions and set them as defaults to open the game if not an .exe.

Advantages: Proton Filetype Linking - Experimental Feature (Tested and works but still)
For those using Proton, IGame2 has a button that says Associate. This button works easy wonders :) jk but it is useful.
To use it: Press the button then select a file with the filetype extension you would like to associate to a program (lets say .gba)
Then another FileDialog will appear after, now select the program you would like to associate with this filetype...for example (vba-m.exe)
Then ta-da now when you press on your game title instead of an error asking if you want to continue because I have yet to make it graceful...
It should launch your game via the associated program. (You should not need to associate each game just the file type!)
Testing and working but an experimental feature.

Opinion you may have: This program is ugly and simple (Yes it's a simple trial beta that works as a baseline proof of concept for now, I will add themes and improvements when 200+ people join the ...ok maybe 50+ join the discord server I have yet to create)

Are there other programs like this that are better....likely yes...almost certainly....this one is like 70kb in size though.

Why choose IGame2 for your game collection....As of this trial beta.....there is no reason it's here if you want it.... :) simple as that, fits my needs thus far.
